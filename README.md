A WordPress plugin that allows selected post types to redirect to external URLs.

## Description

This plugin adds an "External Link" section to the post editor.

If you're publishing posts that are primarily used to link to external news articles or resources, the plugin overrides the postâ€™s permalink and redirects users to the specified external URL when they click the post.

The "External Link" section has two options:

1. External link (This URL will replace the return value of `the_permalink`)
2. Open in new window (checkbox)

By setting an external link, the link in your widget, post archive and so on, will refer to the new URL you saved.

### Settings

This plugin adds a new section to Writing Settings with 3 different options.

#### 1. Post Types

Lets you select which post types should support external links.

#### 2. Attributes

When set to Automatic, the target and rel attributes will be automatically added to anchor elements linking to the new URL, using jQuery.

When set to Manual, developers must manually add anchor elements. You can either use `tsep_anchor_attributes()` to generate the href, rel and target attributes, or use `the_permalink()` to populate the href attribute and `tsep_target_attributes()` to add the target and rel attributes separately.

**Easy method:**
```php
<a <?php echo tsep_anchor_attributes(123); ?> class="some-class">Click here!</a>
```

**With separate attributes:**
```php
<a href="<?php echo the_permalink(123); ?>" <?php echo tsep_anchor_attributes(123); ?> class="some-class">Click here!</a>
```

#### 3. Single Page Content

This option allows you to manually write an anchor element that will be added to the post's content. Use %link% for the external link, and %rel% for the target and rel attributes.

```php
<a href="%link%" %rel%>Click here!</a>
```

This will produce the following output:

```php
<a href="https://example.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here!</a>
```
